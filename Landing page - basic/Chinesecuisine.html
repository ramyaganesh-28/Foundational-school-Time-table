            <h1>Stir-Frying and Steaming</h1>
            <p>
                Stir-frying and steaming are two common cooking techniques in Chinese cuisine. Stir-frying involves quickly cooking ingredients in a hot wok with oil, allowing for fast cooking and the retention of the ingredients' textures and flavors.<br>
                 Steaming is a gentle cooking method that preserves the natural flavors and nutrients of the ingredients, often used for seafood, vegetables, and dim sum.
